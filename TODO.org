* TODO Maybe change code to initialise full list on start with empty dicts - will allow frame skipping but break backwards compatibility
Could modify pkl loading to fix backwards compatibility if assumed older ones are in sequence
* TODO Or re-write all code to use a dictionary of dictionaries only, this is bug-free
* TODO Atm can skip lines if cannot see tail, etc. but these CANNOT be the final frame left done - fix this?, also breaks resuming
* TODO Atm only saves data for current frame when tail2 is clicked
* TODO What to do with invalid frames??
* TODO Write R script, 
R script: modify angles where topbottom=B, then iterate through data
- in the below half the angle is (90-angle)+90 - but only if default
is above, if default is below is inverse, make this an option
frame find max angle, set that to start cycle 1, so on

* TODO make backup data files
* TODO Add button to reassume old baseline, tail midpoint - forward and backward how to do without 4 buttons, bugs - use menus
* TODO Fix PNG zooming, panning - reenable support
* TODO Add overwrite warning
* TODO Make user guide add to github for interviews

* TODO Fix changing tail base point undraws previous basepoint
* TODO Make draw tail basepoint not continue if autorun not on, not imporant
* TODO fix file path issue - on Windows is saving data files to images directory (os.chdir?) - might leave this
* TODO Add keyboard shortcuts for graph management - undo button
* TODO Add help screen

* TODO Tidy functions, implement classes, etc.
* DONE Fix load next frame not drawing tailline
* DONE Add circle ot base of tail, 
* DONE make open all files in directory rather than individual files
* DONE Make reloading data redraw baseline and parallel line - set current base line

* DONE Start at previously finished frame - enable autorun, click tails
* DONE Add button to save current image
* DONE Fix screen height bug - make data scrollable!
* DONE Save extension of tail as well
* DONE Link Status bar to hovering
* DONE Fix button disables in modes
* DONE Fix frame setting on loading data
* DONE Make Github page
* DONE Fix changing base line doesn't draw parallel line
* DONE Update Frame numbers in label on changing image
* DONE Fix label numbers in status bar - copy code from hovering
* DONE Save data to file and to data viewer
* DONE Sort out recalculating angle on changing base line
* DONE Fix regression in flashing when going previous frame
* DONE Modify NextFrame to depend on clickstate
* DONE Link up instructions
* DONE Add ability to go back - loading previous points
* DONE Add solid state management - can exit and enter different states without possibility of crashing
* DONE Sort out sensitivity of buttons with respect to states
* DONE Add parallel line through tail base
* DONE Show frame number in instructions
* DONE Press escape to cancel current line
* DONE Add button to set current line mode
* DONE Display current line mode
* DONE Add clicking to draw lines - save baseline for all images - http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5021663/how-to-draw-a-line-outside-of-an-axis-in-matplotlib-in-figure-coordinates
* DONE MPL event handling: http://matplotlib.org/users/event_handling.html
* DONE Work out how to calculate angles - use vectors from start,endpoints angle is same, dotproduct
* DONE Link up tool bar items
* DONE Save data - can edit points, recalculate, etc. but data always being saved
* DONE Add stuff to calculate useful data - cycles, etc. - will use R script instead
* DONE Speed up loading arrays - deleting and redrawing the problem
* DONE Add ability to load data file to continue session
* DONE Fix bugs in file loading window
